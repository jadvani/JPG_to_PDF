This is a Python3-based app created using Tkinter to join and convert JPG files to PDF.

These dependencies must be installed for its usage:

* PIL
* tkinter
* tkinterdnd2
* fpdf

 
 export the app as an .exe windows file using this command (pynstaller library must be available too for that):
pyinstaller --onefile --icon=logo.ico --noconsole test_app2.py


TODO:

* Add a button to choose the input files from path instead of the drag & drop way only.
* Add a button to choose the file output path
* improve the UX design somehow, add a background image to the interface.
